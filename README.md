# PacmanProgressBar in Elixir

Inspiration from [Cool CLIs in Elixir with IO.write/2 by Dennis Beatty](https://dennisbeatty.com/cool-clis-in-elixir-with-io-write-2/), [progress_bar by henrik](https://github.com/henrik/progress_bar), and my own old project [PacmanProgressBar in Java](https://gitlab.com/Pistrie/pacmanprogressbar)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `pacman_progress_bar` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pacman_progress_bar, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/pacman_progress_bar>.
